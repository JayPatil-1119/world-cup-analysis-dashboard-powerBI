## 1. Problem Statement

World Cup cricket generates massive amounts of match and player-level data, but key challenges include:

Difficulty understanding overall tournament performance at a glance

No clear comparison of batting performances across players and teams

Limited visibility into bowling impact and wicket-taking ability

Lack of a consolidated view to identify top-performing players

These challenges make it hard to evaluate performance and extract meaningful insights quickly.

## 2. Objective

The objective of this project is to develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that:

Provides a high-level overview of the World Cup

Analyzes batting performance to identify top run scorers and consistency

Evaluates bowling performance to highlight key wicket-takers

Enables quick comparison across teams and players

Presents insights through clean, intuitive visuals
